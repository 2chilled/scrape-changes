# scrape-changes
This library scrapes websites and invokes callbacks when there are changes, similar to a RSS reader.
Sending an email by invoking sendmail is a built-in callback mechanism. Of course, users can provide 
their own callback function in addition.

Once it is practically tested by myself I will add it to hackage.
